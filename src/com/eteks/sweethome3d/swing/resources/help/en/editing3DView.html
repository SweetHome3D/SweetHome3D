		<p>When <i>Aerial view</i> is selected, the 3D view displays your home  in 3 dimensions seen from a top point of view.
		  In this mode, moving the mouse to the left or to the right with its left button pressed makes the home turn around
		  a vertical axis located at home
	  center&nbsp;; moving the mouse forward or backward with its left button pressed makes the home turn around an horizontal
	  axis&nbsp;;
	  rolling the mouse wheel zooms in or out in the 3D view. <br>
	  When <i>Virtual visit </i> is selected, the 3D view displays your home
	  in 3 dimensions seen from the point of view of a virtual visitor. In this mode, moving the mouse to the left or to
	  the right with its left button pressed makes the visitor body turn to the left or to the right&nbsp;;
		  moving the mouse forward or backward with its left button pressed makes the visitor head turn up or down&nbsp;;
		  rolling the mouse wheel makes the visitor move backward or forward. <br>
		  In both modes, the left arrow and right arrow keys have the same effect as mouse lateral moves  ; page up and page
		  down keys have the same effect as mouse moves forward and backward&nbsp;; up arrow and down
		  arrow keys have the same effect as mouse wheel.</p>
		<p>When <i>Virtual visit </i> is selected, a virtual visitor seen from top is also drawn in home plan. Its location and
		  its  angle is updated simultaneously 
	   in plan and 3D view at each move of the visitor. This virtual visitor is surrounded by  three  indicators.</p>
