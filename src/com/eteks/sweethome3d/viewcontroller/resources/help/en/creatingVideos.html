          video...</i> menu item or click on the <i>Create video</i> tool.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>This will display a dialog box similar to the one dedicated to <a href="creatingPhotos.html">photos</a> 
          creation.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/creatingVideos.jpg"></p>
        <p>At the top of this pane, appears the plan of your home upon which the 
          virtual path of the video camera will be drawn. Below the plan, the 
          recording, playback and deletion buttons helps you to record the points 
          the camera path shall pass by, playback the recorded path or remove 
          some path points. <br>
          The <i>Video format</i> combo box lets you choose the size, apect ratio 
          and frame rate of the video, among most common formats.<br>
          The <i>Quality</i> slider and possibly other fields are the same as 
          the one found in the <a href="creatingPhotos.html">photo</a> creation 
          pane.</p>
        <p>To create a video, choose the initial location of the video camera 
          in the 3D view of Sweet Home 3D main window, and click on the red button 
          in the video creation pane. Then move in the 3D view to the next location 
          of the video camera and click again on the red button. Repeat these 
          steps for each location the camera should pass by during the video. 
          <br>
          Each time you click on the red button, a new point is added in the plan 
          displayed by the video creation pane to show you the path of the camera.<br>
          Once you're satisfied by the path you created, click on the <i>Create</i> 
          button to start the computing of the video frames. Once this computing 
          is finished, click on the <i>Save...</i> button to save the video in 
          a Quicktime file. You may view this video with differents tools like 
          <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> or transcode it in an other 
          format.<br>

                  the video and let you create all kind of animations. <br>
                  At the two best quality levels, you may also set a different 
                  hour at each recorded point even if you didn't move the camera 
                  between two recorded points. If the hour set at the first recorded 
                  point is at the beginning of the day and the hour set at the 
                  second point is at the end of the day, you'll get an animation
