To add a new level, choose <i>Plan &gt; Add new level</i> from the menu. As soon as a home has more then one level, some tabs appear at the top of the plan view and let you select the level into which you want to add some items. At the end of the tabs list, appears also a tab with a <font size="+1"><b>+</b></font> sign that you can use to create more levels if needed.

      <p>To help you find your place in an upper level, walls and ceilings of the lower level are displayed with a light color in the plan view. If the edited level is the lowest level, walls and floors of the next level will be drawn in a light color. When magnetism is active, the cursor is magnetized on these  walls and rooms to let you use more easily wall or room drawing tools. If needed you may also simply copy some walls, rooms or furniture from an other level to paste them in the new level.</p>
      <p>Each level has an elevation and other attributes that can be <a href="editingLevels.html">changed</a>, and if the walls or some furniture added to a lower level are higher than the elevation of the selected level they will appear in full color, as the surrounding walls and the staircase and the window on the right in the next figure.</p>
