    <td><p>You may edit the location, the size, the elevation and the angle of 
          home furniture, either with the mouse or with the <i>Furniture &gt; 
          Modify...</i> menu item.<br>
          To edit pieces of furniture with the mouse, select them in the home 
          plan or furniture list first. To select&nbsp;one piece in the plan, 
          click on it. To select multiple pieces in the plan, draw a selection 
          rectangle around them, or click on pieces while pressing <i>shift</i> 
          key. <br>
          To avoid selecting furniture with other kinds of objects in the plan, 
          lock the base plan by clicking on the lock displayed at the top left 
          of the plan pane or by choosing <i>Plan &gt; Lock base plan</i> out 
          of the menu. This will disallow the selection of walls, rooms, dimensions, 
          free texts, doors and windows, to let you arrange your furniture more 
          easily. Clicking a second time on the lock or adding any object to the 
          plan that is not a piece of furniture will unlock the plan.<br>
          To move the selected pieces, place the mouse pointer inside the selected 
          box of one these pieces then drag and drop them, or press the keyboard 
          arrows. When the mouse cursor is upon a wall during the move of <b>one</b> piece, 
          that piece will be automatically rotated and resized according to the 
          orientation and the thickness of the wall if it's a door or a window, 
          wheras a piece of an other kind is oriented so its back face lies along 
          the wall.<br>
          If you want to handle selected pieces as one piece of furniture (for 
          example a table with its chairs), choose <i>Furniture &gt; Group</i> 
          out of the menu.</p>
      <p> When <b>one</b> piece or <b>one</b> group of pieces is selected in 
          the plan, you may also change its size, elevation or angle with one 
          of the four indicators that appear at each corner of the selected piece.</p>
